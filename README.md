## Getting Started with Aalogbeat

### Installing

* Download a [release](https://github.com/logic-danderson/aalogbeat/releases)
* Extract the ZIP
* Edit aalogbeat.yml to configure Aalogbeat, including where to find the log files and how to connect to Elasticsearch. See aalogbeat.reference.yml for examples and descriptions.
* Use the install-service-aalogbeat.ps1 PowerShell script to register Aalogeat as a Windows service.

to run as a Windows service.

### Test

To test Aalogbeat, run the following command:

```
make testsuite
```

alternatively:
```
make unit-tests
make system-tests
make integration-tests
make coverage-report
```

The test coverage is reported in the folder `./build/coverage/`

### Update

Each beat has a template for the mapping in elasticsearch and a documentation for the fields
which is automatically generated based on `fields.yml` by running the following command. 

```
make update
```


### Publishing Dashboards

Copy the files it generated in _meta/kibana.generated/7/dashboard to kibana/7/dashboard. 
Then run:

```
./aalogbeat setup --dashboards
```

### Exporting Dashboards

To export dashboards for inclusion into the project, run:

```
go run vendor/github.com/elastic/beats/dev-tools/cmd/dashboards/export_dashboards.go -yml dashboards.yml
```

That will update the dashboard files under _meta/kibana/7/dashboard.

Then run:

```
make update
````

Which will copy the dashboard files from _meta/kibana/7/dashboard to _meta/kibana.generated/7/dashboard.

### Cleanup

To clean  Aalogbeat source code, run the following command:

```
make fmt
```

To clean up the build directory and generated artifacts, run:

```
make clean
```

## Packaging

The beat frameworks provides tools to crosscompile and package your beat for different platforms. This requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and vendoring as described above. To build packages of your beat, run the following command:

```
make release
```

This will fetch and create all images required for the build process. The whole process to finish can take several minutes.
